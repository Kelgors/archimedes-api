Maybe use:

- @fastify-userland/typeorm-query-runner
- @fastify/cors
- @fastify/csrf-protection
- @fastify/etag
- @fastify/rate-limit
- @fastify/static
- mvp(user can CRUD lists,tags&bookmarks)
- share list between users
- list can be non-referenced (public if you have the url)
- anonymous can see public lists without logging in and without knowing the list url
- share list between instances
